Painter
Write a piece of code that receives 2 numbers - width & height and creates a drawing area of 
width by height cells. Each cell can be clicked and that will change its color. Another click on the same cell will change it back to white.

Bonus:
Color picker
Ability to “drag & draw” (click once, paint by moving the mouse)
Design the page nicely for a good user experience

Please use HTML, CSS and pure JS only (no jQuery) and be prepared to explain your code.

Thanks and good luck!
